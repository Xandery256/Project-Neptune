# Concept Document
 
 
### Game Title:
TBD
 
### Intended Audience:
Adult (18+) who like atmospheric horror shooters.
 
### High Concept:
You are a new shipwright stationed on a space station shipyard that is in disarray. Something has gone horribly wrong. It is up to you to explore the station and uncover its secrets.
 
### Genre:
FPS/Action/Horror. Inspired by Deep Space, Space Station 13, and Space Beast Terror Fright.
 
### Description:
*Describe the look and feel of your game. Briefly describe the game world, the player’s place in it, and so on. Give more detail than in the “High Concept” section above.*
You are a shipwright who has been sent to a space station/shipyard tasked with helping the station in its endeavours (unknowingly humanity’s escape vessel). However, the station itself has been overtaken by a unknown hostile force. You begin with a brief introduction of where you've been sent, why, and perhaps a short sentence or two detailing how the station is frequently viewed. Your shuttle docks on the station, the doors snap open, and you are greeted to a station that is less than functional. 
 
### Story:
*What is your game’s story? Why is the player here and what is s/he doing? What is his/her eventual goal? (Even if your game doesn’t have an explicit story, with characters and dialogue, it should have background and goal(s) for the player.)*
You are a shipwright sent to a space station. Your role is to help them work on the various ships they are trying to build (and encountering issues with) as well as repair the station. Upon arrival, you learn that much has occurred since you've been requested and you must do what you can to find who's alive and escape (via the "Ark"). Background motive is survival :)
 
### Settings/Environments:
*List and briefly detail the setting(s)/environment(s) in which your game takes place. What will the player see in your game? Where will s/he go?*
Dark, eerie atmosphere. Industrial-style space station shipyard. Narrow hallways. Different sized rooms. Multiple vertical levels. Largely want to provide the feeling of claustrophobia while giving the player times to breathe. 
 
### Features/Gameplay:
*List the important features of your game and give examples of its gameplay. This section should complement the “Description” section above, not duplicate it. A bullet list would work well. How does this gameplay fit your story and setting?*

* Equipment/Upgrades (e.g. new movement options, upgrades to your weapon, new weapons, etc)
* Metroid-esque areas where you must retrieve new equipment for your character to progress
 
### USPs:
*What are your game’s Unique Selling Points? What’s different about it?*
Setting/Mini-bosses
